php-moodserver
==============

The server side of my master thesis app

This is a bundle for the Symfony2 framework. It enables bipolar patients to track their mood on a daily basis, and medical 
personel can gain access to reports on their patients. It includes an HTTP API consisting of only the opportunity to POST the 
tracked data, and an Android app is designed to give the patients notifications when it is desired that the data should be 
logged.
